# shyftlabs-demo-app

Here are the steps to run my demo web application:
1. cd front-end
2. npm install
3. npm start
4. This should open a browser displaying my web application on one of your localhost ports (usually localhost:3000)!
Now you can navigate to the different pages like Students, Courses, Results, etc. using the sidebar on the left.
