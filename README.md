# shyftlabs-demo-app

Here are the steps to run my web application:
1. git clone https://github.com/TaranGilll/shyftlabs-demo-app.git
2. cd shyftlabs-demo-app/front-end
3. npm install
4. npm start
5. This should open a browser displaying my web application on one of your localhost ports (usually localhost:3000)!
Now you can navigate to the different pages like Students, Courses, Results, etc. using the sidebar on the left.
6. Note: On the very first time you open the page expect the students/courses table to take some time to load. This is because I'm using the cheapest AWS Lambda containers.
